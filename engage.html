        <h1>How youth can engage in blood donation camps</h1>
        <p>Knowledge regarding blood donation was adequate among 228 (57.1%) of the students and, 221 (55.4%) students had donated blood. Knowledge was significantly better among female students, medical stream and in those whose parents were in non-medical jobs; whereas blood donation had been done significantly more by male, non-medical stream students and by those whose parents were in medical field. Most common reason for donating blood was a sense of social responsibility and most common reason of non-donation was fear of the procedure. An 85% of the students were of the view that they would donate blood if asked. Students suggested that small incentives like certificates and arranging transport for blood donation would make it easier to donate.</p>
        <p>A total of 399 college students from different streams participated in the study. Mean age of the study population was 20 (SD=2.4) years, with the ages ranging from 17years to 30years. Two thirds of them were males and almost the same proportions were from urban background </p>
        <p>Of the total, 228 (57.1%) students had adequate knowledge and 171(42.9%) had less than adequate knowledge on various aspects of blood donation. Univariate regression analysis showed that the adequacy of knowledge varied significantly according to gender (OR=5.08 {3.06-8.42}), study course (OR=8.36 {5.23-13.37}) and parentsâ€™ job (OR=3.42 {1.1-10.7}); whereas there was no difference in adequacy of knowledge according to rural and urban resident status of the students or with type of family [Table/Fig-2]. These factors were also having independent effect on knowledge [Table/Fig-3]. As regards the donation practice, 221 (55.4%) of the students had donated blood at least once. Voluntary blood donation was significantly more common among non-medical students (OR=20.13 {11.96-33.86}), males (OR=5.31 {3.34-8.43}), ones with parents in medical jobs (OR=4.67 {2.78-7.85}) and belonging to joint family (OR=2.85 {1.82-4.45}) in univariate analysis [Table/Fig-4]. However, on multivariate analysis, type of family showed no bearing on donation behaviour of the students but rest of the factors were independently associated with blood donation behaviour of students. Knowledge was inversely related to donation with students with inadequate knowledge having donated three times more often than ones with adequate knowledge [Table/Fig-5]. There was no difference in knowledge or donor behaviour of students from rural or urban background.</p>
        <p>Blood is essential to help patients survive surgeries, cancer treatment, chronic illnesses, and traumatic injuries. This lifesaving care starts with one person making a generous donation. The need for blood is constant.</p>
