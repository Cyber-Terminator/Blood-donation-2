        <!--How blood donation camps help in the past 2 years in the pandemic-->
        <h1>How Blood donation camps helped during the pandemic</h1>
        <p>Of the 7122 people that responded to the survey, 1205 (16·9%) blood donors were identified, with 33·8% donating during the first 4–5 months of the COVID‐19 period. We observed that around half of donors donated less than normal. The vast majority of donors that did donate made a special effort to do so in response to COVID‐19. The majority of donors were also not aware of their blood being tested for COVID‐19 antibodies. Although the perceived risk of infection among all respondents whilst donating blood was relatively low, those who anticipated a high risk of infection were much less likely to donate (OR = 0·540; P‐value = 0·006). Furthermore, those that were adherent to COVID guidelines were also less likely to donate (OR = 0·583; P‐value = 0·000).</p>
        <p>It has already been 6 months since the first case of COVD-19 disease was reported [14]. But we still do not have any definitive treatment and most of the available therapeutics are being tried based on either previous outbreak experience, or preliminary results on COVID-19 patients. Recently, convalescent plasma therapy has been under consideration as a potential therapeutic strategy to transfer passive immunity from recovered individuals to active patients [15], [16]. While the strategy seems logical and is based on positive evidence from the SARS outbreak, convalescent plasma therapy could be challenging to execute. Finding an ABO matched compatible donor, significant neutralizing antibody titers, complete recovery from COVID-19 symptoms, a documented negative COVID-19 PCR, and willingness to donate are only a few amongst the many challenges to accomplish convalescent plasma therapy donation. Proper education, counseling, awareness of civic responsibility, and an established and structured taskforce play a key role in encouraging recovered patients to donate plasma. Hospital-based blood donor centers have the advantage to readily identify the potential candidates while they are still recovering from COVID-19 and to initiate the documentation process for collection of convalescent plasma at a later date, which should save a lot of time and effort. Mayo Clinic is leading the COVID-19 expanded access program and is helping all the health care facilities, transfusion medicine programs, and blood donation societies for effective execution of the convalescent therapy program [17].</p>
        <p>During the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic, with all Educational Institutions closed and the lockdowns, UBTS experienced shortage of blood supplies and had to use innovative ways of mobilizing blood donors. A call center in Nakasero blood bank in Kampala was created to reach donors in the communities, and the youths nationwide. A donor recruitment application, “Blood 4 Uganda”, was developed that links UBTS to donors, the majority of whom often use social media platforms like twitter, Facebook, Telegram. The application and the e-donor recruitment strategies improved communication to blood donors in communities and enabled cost-effective mobilization in these challenging times.</p>
        <p>The Red Cross has experienced a 10% decline in the number of people donating blood since the beginning of the pandemic and continues to confront relentless issues due to the pandemic, including ongoing blood drive cancellations and staffing limitations. Adding to the concern is the surge of COVID-19 cases. The Red Cross has experienced low donor turnout ever since the delta variant began spreading in August, and that trend continues as the Omicron variant takes over.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, COVID-19 is a pandemic crisis that needs a collaborative effort from blood donors, community, blood transfusion services, and administration. A message should be clearly sent out that “To wipe out COVID-19, we bid for social distancing, not social disengagement”.</p>
